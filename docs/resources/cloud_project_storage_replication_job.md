# ovh_cloud_project_storage_replication_job

Trigger a one-time replication job for a storage container. This is useful for catch-up replication of existing objects when setting up new replication rules.

~> **Note:** Once triggered, replication jobs cannot be cancelled or deleted. The resource will be removed from Terraform state upon destruction, but the replication job will continue running on the OVH platform.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "ovh_cloud_project_storage_replication_job" "catchup" {
  service_name   = "xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  region_name    = "GRA"
  container_name = "my-source-container"
}
```
