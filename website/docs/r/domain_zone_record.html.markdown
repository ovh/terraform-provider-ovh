# ovh_domain_zone_record

Provides a OVHcloud domain zone record.

!> The `Change in text format` feature available in the web console will update the `ovh_domain_zone_record` ids if you use it. Hence if you have created your records with terraform, you will get some `record has been deleted` errors. The workaround is to `terraform import` all the records with the updated ids and to stop to mix web console and terraform.

~> __WARNING__ This resource and resource `ovh_domain_zone_import` should not be used together as `ovh_domain_zone_import` controls the whole DNS zone at once.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Add a record to a sub-domain
resource "ovh_domain_zone_record" "test" {
  zone      = "testdemo.ovh"
  subdomain = "test"
  fieldtype = "A"
  ttl       = 3600
  target    = "0.0.0.0"
}
```
