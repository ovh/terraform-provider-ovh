## Important

This can be done in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/manager/#/dedicated/billing/payment/method) or via API with the [/me/payment/method](https://api.ovh.com/console/#/me/payment/method~GET) endpoint.

~> __WARNING__ `BANK_ACCOUNT` is not supported anymore, please update your default payment_method to `SEPA_DIRECT_DEBIT`
