# ovh_cloud_project_database

Creates a OVHcloud Managed Database Service in a public cloud project.

## Important

To learn more about OVHcloud Public Cloud Database please visit our [public documentation](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/publiccloud/databases).

You can visit our dedicated Discord channel: https://discord.gg/PwPqWUpN8G. Ask questions, provide feedback and interact directly with the team that builds our databases services and terraform provider.

## Example Usage

Minimum settings for each engine (region choice is up to the user):

{{tffile "examples/resources/cloud_project_database/example_1.tf"}}

To deploy a business PostgreSQL service with two nodes on public network:

{{tffile "examples/resources/cloud_project_database/example_2.tf"}}

To deploy an enterprise MongoDB service with three nodes on private network:

{{tffile "examples/resources/cloud_project_database/example_3.tf"}}

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `service_name` - (Required, Forces new resource) The id of the public cloud project. If omitted, the `OVH_CLOUD_PROJECT_SERVICE` environment variable is used.
* `description` - (Optional) Small description of the database service.
* `engine` - (Required, Forces new resource) The database engine you want to deploy. To get a full list of available engine visit. [public documentation](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/publiccloud/databases).
* `flavor` - (Required) A valid OVHcloud public cloud database flavor name in which the nodes will be started. Ex: "db1-7". Changing this value upgrade the nodes with the new flavor. You can find the list of flavor names: https://www.ovhcloud.com/fr/public-cloud/prices/

* `nodes` - (Required, Minimum Items: 1) List of nodes object. Multi region cluster are not yet available, all node should be identical.
  * `network_id` - (Optional, Forces new resource) Private network id in which the node should be deployed. It's the regional openstackId of the private network
  * `region` - (Required, Forces new resource) Public cloud region in which the node should be deployed. Ex: "GRA'.
  * `subnet_id` - (Optional, Forces new resource) Private subnet ID in which the node is.
