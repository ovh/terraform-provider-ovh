# ovh_cloud_project

Orders a public cloud project.

## Important

-> **NOTE** To order a product through Terraform, your account needs to have a default payment method defined. This can be done in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/manager/#/dedicated/billing/payment/method) or via API with the [/me/payment/method](https://api.ovh.com/console/#/me/payment/method~GET) endpoint.

~> **WARNING** `BANK_ACCOUNT` is not supported anymore, please update your default payment method to `SEPA_DIRECT_DEBIT`

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/resources/cloud_project/example_1.tf"}}

-> **WARNING** Currently, the OVHcloud Terraform provider does not support deletion of a public cloud project in the US. Removal is possible by manually deleting the project and then manually removing the public cloud project from terraform state.

## HDS Certification

If you want to add the certification HDS option at project creation (you must have a business support level on your account), you can add hds datasource and the plan_option configuration on the `ovh_cloud_project`.
