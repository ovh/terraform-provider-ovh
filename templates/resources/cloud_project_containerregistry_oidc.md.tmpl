* `oidc_client_secret` - The secret for the Harbor client application.
* `oidc_scope` - The scope sent to OIDC server during authentication. It's a comma-separated string that must contain 'openid' and usually also contains 'profile' and 'email'. To obtain refresh tokens it should also contain 'offline_access'.
* `oidc_groups_claim` - The name of Claim in the ID token whose value is the list of group names.
* `oidc_admin_group` - Specify an OIDC admin group name. All OIDC users in this group will have harbor admin privilege. Keep it blank if you do not want to.
* `oidc_verify_cert` - Set it to `false` if your OIDC server is hosted via self-signed certificate.
* `oidc_auto_onboard` - Skip the onboarding screen, so user cannot change its username. Username is provided from ID Token.
* `oidc_user_claim` - The name of the claim in the ID Token where the username is retrieved from. If not specified, it will default to 'name' (only useful when automatic Onboarding is enabled).
* `delete_users` - Delete existing users from Harbor. OIDC can't be enabled if there is at least one user already created. This parameter is only used at OIDC configuration creation. **Changing this value recreates the resource.**
