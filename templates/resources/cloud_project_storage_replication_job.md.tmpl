# ovh_cloud_project_storage_replication_job

Trigger a one-time replication job for a storage container. This is useful for catch-up replication of existing objects when setting up new replication rules.

~> **Note:** Once triggered, replication jobs cannot be cancelled or deleted. The resource will be removed from Terraform state upon destruction, but the replication job will continue running on the OVH platform.
