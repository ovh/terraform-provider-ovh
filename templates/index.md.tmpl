# OVH Provider

The OVH provider is the entry point to interact with the resources provided by OVHcloud.

-> **NOTE** According on your needs, you may need to use additional providers. This [documentation page](https://help.ovhcloud.com/csm/en-gb-terraform-at-ovhcloud?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0054612) provides the mapping between the control panel concepts and the terraform providers / resources.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Provider configuration

The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used. Requests to OVHcloud APIs require a set of secrets keys and the definition of the API end point. See [First Steps with the API](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/customer/first-steps-with-ovh-api/) (or the French version, [Premiers pas avec les API OVHcloud](https://docs.ovh.com/fr/api/api-premiers-pas/)) for a detailed explanation.

Three forms of authentication are supported by the provider:
- OAuth2, using scoped service accounts, and compatible with OVHcloud IAM
- Short-lived access token received from [OVH API](https://support.us.ovhcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/19901571606547-Using-Service-Accounts-to-Connect-to-OVHcloud-APIs) (for example with aid of Hashicorp Vault OAuth2 secret engine configured to work with OVH auth api).
- Application key & application secret & consumer key

### OAuth2

First, you need to generate a pair of valid `client_id` and `client_secret`: you can proceed by [following this documentation](https://help.ovhcloud.com/csm/en-manage-service-account?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0059343).

Once you have retrieved your `client_id` and `client_secret`, these parameters can be configured directly in the provider block as shown hereafter.

Terraform 0.13 and later:

{{tffile "examples/example_1.tf"}}

Alternatively it is suggested to use configuration files or environment variables so that the same code may run seamlessly in multiple environments. Production and development for instance.

The provider will first look for direct instantiation parameters then `OVH_ENDPOINT`, `OVH_CLIENT_ID` and `OVH_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables. If either of these parameter is not provided, it will look for a configuration file of the form:

```ini
[default]
; general configuration: default endpoint
endpoint=ovh-eu

[ovh-eu]
; configuration specific to 'ovh-eu' endpoint
client_id=my_client_id
client_secret=my_client_secret
```

The client will successively attempt to locate this configuration file in

1. Current working directory: `./ovh.conf`
2. Current user's home directory: `~/.ovh.conf`
3. System wide configuration: `/etc/ovh.conf`

Depending on the API you want to use, you may set the `endpoint` to:

* `ovh-eu` for OVHcloud Europe API
* `ovh-us` for OVHcloud US API
* `ovh-ca` for OVHcloud Canada API

This lookup mechanism makes it easy to overload credentials for a specific project or user.

You can find more details about the configuration parsing on repository [go-ovh](https://github.com/ovh/go-ovh).

### Access token

The provider will look for the token either at `OVH_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable, or get it via `access_token` argument in the provider's stanza.

Similarly to OAuth2 method, the endpoint must be configured (either via `endpoint` argument, or with `OVH_ENDPOINT` environment variable).

### Application Key/Application Secret

The required keys are the `application_key`, the `application_secret`, and the `consumer_key`. These keys can be generated via the [OVHcloud token generation page](https://api.ovh.com/createToken/?GET=/*&POST=/*&PUT=/*&DELETE=/*).

These parameters can be configured directly in the provider block as shown hereafter.

Terraform 0.13 and later:

{{tffile "examples/example_2.tf"}}

Alternatively it is suggested to use configuration files or environment variables so that the same code may run seamlessly in multiple environments. Production and development for instance.

The provider will first look for direct instantiation parameters then `OVH_ENDPOINT`, `OVH_APPLICATION_KEY`, `OVH_APPLICATION_SECRET` and `OVH_CONSUMER_KEY` environment variables. If either of these parameter is not provided, it will look for a configuration file of the form:

```ini
[default]
; general configuration: default endpoint
endpoint=ovh-eu

[ovh-eu]
; configuration specific to 'ovh-eu' endpoint
application_key=my_app_key
application_secret=my_application_secret
consumer_key=my_consumer_key
```

Depending on the API you want to use, you may set the `endpoint` to:

* `ovh-eu` for OVHcloud Europe API
* `ovh-us` for OVHcloud US API
* `ovh-ca` for OVHcloud Canada API
* `soyoustart-eu` for So you Start Europe API
* `soyoustart-ca` for So you Start Canada API
* `kimsufi-eu` for Kimsufi Europe API
* `kimsufi-ca` for Kimsufi Canada API
* Or any arbitrary URL to use in a test for example

The provider will successively attempt to locate this configuration file in

1. Current working directory: `./ovh.conf`
2. Current user's home directory `~/.ovh.conf`
3. System wide configuration `/etc/ovh.conf`

This lookup mechanism makes it easy to overload credentials for a specific project or user.

You can find more details about the configuration parsing on repository [go-ovh](https://github.com/ovh/go-ovh).

To list and revoke your API keys, you can read [the following documentation](https://help.ovhcloud.com/csm/en-ie-api-getting-started-ovhcloud-api?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0042786#list-and-revoke-your-keys).

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/example_3.tf"}}

## Configuration Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `endpoint` - (Optional) Specify which API endpoint to use. It can be set using the `OVH_ENDPOINT` environment variable. e.g. `ovh-eu` or `ovh-ca`.

* `application_key` - (Optional) The API Application Key. If omitted, the `OVH_APPLICATION_KEY` environment variable is used.

* `application_secret` - (Optional) The API Application Secret. If omitted, the `OVH_APPLICATION_SECRET` environment variable is used.

* `consumer_key` - (Optional) The API Consumer key. If omitted, the `OVH_CONSUMER_KEY` environment variable is used.

* `client_id` - (Optional) The OAuth2 client ID. If omitted, the `OVH_CLIENT_ID` environment variable is used.

* `client_id` - (Optional) The OAuth2 client secret. If omitted, the `OVH_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable is used.

* `access_token` - (Optional) The OVH API Access Token. If omitted, the `OVH_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable is used.

* `user_agent_extra` - (Optional) Extra information to append at the end of the user-agent used when making API calls.

* `api_rate_limit` - (Optional) Specify the API request rate limit, X operations by seconds. If omitted, unlimited.

* `ignore_init_error` - (Optional) **⚠️ Use with caution and only if you know what you are doing.** If set to `true`, the provider will skip authentication validation during initialization. If omitted, the `OVH_IGNORE_INIT_ERROR` environment variable is used. This allows the provider to load even with invalid credentials, but any actual API calls will still fail. This is intended for development/testing purposes only where valid credentials are not available but the provider configuration must be present.

### Using a locally built terraform-provider-ovh

If you wish to test the provider from the local version you just built, you can try the following method.

First install the terraform provider binary into your local plugin repository:

```sh
# Set your target environment (OS_architecture): linux_amd64, darwin_amd64...
$ export ENV="linux_amd64"
$ make build
...
$ mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/plugins/terraform.local/local/ovh/0.0.1/$ENV
$ cp $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-ovh ~/.terraform.d/plugins/terraform.local/local/ovh/0.0.1/$ENV/terraform-provider-ovh_v0.0.1
```

Then create a terraform configuration using this exact provider:

{{tffile "examples/example_4.tf"}}

This allows you to use your unreleased version of the provider. The version number is not important and you can use whatever you like in this example but you need to stay coherent between the configuration, the directory structure and the binary filename.
